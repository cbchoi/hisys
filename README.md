# Hisys (Hierarchical Investigation System) - Product Code

This repository hosts the product code for Hisys. Authoritative requirements,
design, interface, and test documentation live in the controlled pre-develop
package at:

    /home/cbchoi/workspaces/sysailab/pre-develop/Hisys/

This repo is a thin product-code mirror of that package; it does not redefine
requirements or design baselines. When this repo and the controlled docs
disagree, the controlled docs (and `INDEX.md` within them) govern.

## Status

- Increment **I0** (Repository skeleton) - in place.
- Increment **I1** (Schemas + IDs) - initial schema modules and tests in place.
- Increment **I2** (Source governance) - initial in-memory source registry,
  fixture registry, and web compliance gate in place.
- Later increments (I3-I9) are not implemented.

See `docs/traceability/README.md` for the document and SRS ID map.

## Layout

Mirrors `HISYS-REPO-001` (repository-structure baseline):

    src/hisys/
      core/        IDs, time, errors, result types
      schemas/     Pydantic v2 records (source, observation, signal,
                   compliance, perspective, memo, alert, handoff, audit,
                   hermes_trace)
      registry/    source registry and web compliance collection gate
      adapters/    base + hardware/web/agent/Hermes mocks
      investigator/, extraction/, editor/, chief_editor/,
      integrations/, audit/, config/, health/, cli/   (placeholders)

    tests/
      unit/        schema, registry, and adapter unit tests
      integration/ end-to-end trace path test
      fixtures/    declarative fixture data

    scripts/
      validate_traceability.py

## Quick start

The package is pure Python with one runtime dependency (Pydantic v2). Install
into a project-local virtualenv (do not install globally):

    python3 -m venv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -e '.[dev]'
    pytest

`hisys --help` exposes a placeholder CLI.

## Quality and security constraints

- Evidence and interpretation are kept on separate linked records
  (`RawObservation` vs `ExtractedSignal`/`ZettelMemo`).
- Hermes hierarchical collection captures user input ref, parent run ID,
  delegated task / tool invocation IDs, prompt/query and output references,
  Markdown boundary record path, preapproved scope, and approval state, as
  required by `HISYS-IDD-001` HISYS-IF-016 and `HISYS-SCHEMA-001` Section 10.
- Source collection is registry-gated. Web/news sources require controlled
  compliance review metadata before collection.
- No live network calls; adapters are mocks fed from local fixtures.
- No credentials or secrets are committed. Fixture tokens are explicitly fake.

## Traceability

Every schema module declares the requirement and document IDs it implements
in its module docstring. `scripts/validate_traceability.py` checks that every
schema module references at least one HISYS-* requirement ID and that the
end-to-end trace path is exercised by a test.
